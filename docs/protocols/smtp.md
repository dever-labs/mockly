# SMTP

SMTP server that captures emails and applies accept/reject rules.

```yaml
protocols:
  smtp:
    enabled: true
    port: 2525
    domain: mockly.local
    rules:
      - id: reject-spam
        from: "*@spam.example.com"
        action: reject
        message: "550 spam not accepted"
      - id: accept-all
        action: accept
```

Captured emails are visible at `GET /api/emails`.
